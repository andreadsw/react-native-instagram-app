# Basic Instagram app
This is a basic Instagram app which displays a list of users, photos and like button. 
This app is developed with React Native and Redux (State management). 
Using JavaScript, you can build a truly native application that renders native UI components and accesses native device functionality. React Native apps can be publishing in the App Store and PlayStore using the same code. This app was only tested on iOS simulator, not in Android Studio.
